# Project proposal

You might understand american people in an incorrect way or not understand fully if you are not familiar to phrasal verbs. Learning them by heart is boring as everyone knows and even if you finish learning it in this way you are not going to be able to remember most of them in 6 month. It's already happened to my groupmates and me. I think if our teacher was asking each of us random phrasal verbs until we use them automatically we wouldn't forget them in a month. But it takes time. That is why I created this game. I did my best to make the game able to make you know phrasal verbs permanently and I will continue making it better.


You should try to download this game and play. After starting you are going to percieve that this game helps you to gain tons of verbs that you know in russian language but do not in english in a fast and fun way. Знаете как сказать на английском "работать над чем-либо без перерыва"? -To work without any breaks? Или как сказать "музыка стихла", "утащить", "унести"? -Eemmm...? Можно, но, frankly speaking, стыдно и не простительно так говорить, если у Вас уровень английского не beginner и не elementary, как говорил мой наставник по английскому. It is time to level up or refresh your memory aaand start speaking like native speakers!
